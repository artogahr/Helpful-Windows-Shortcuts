Usage
#####################

You need AutoHotKey to use this script.
All shortcuts in this script use the rarely used CapsLock key.
Just CapsLock -> Nothing
CapsLock + Key -> Action
Double-click CapsLock -> Toggle CapsLock

I'll refer to CapsLock as CL from now on.

Easy Navigation:

CL + j -> Down 
CL + k -> Up
CL + h -> Left
CL + l -> Right

Desktop Switching:

CL + i -> Right Desktop (Ctrl + Win + Right)
CL + u -> Left Desktop (Ctrl + Win + Left)

Miscellanous:

CL + r -> Build & Run for Visual Studio and alike (Ctrl + R)
CL + q -> Quit Application (Alt + F4)
CL + g -> Google the selected text


More shortcuts will be added in the future. Feel free to create an issue for any shortcut you want to be added.
